ChemRxiv. Preprint. https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv.11522565.v3 Many nanoparticles show enhanced catalytic activity on particular surfaces. Hence, a key challenge is to identify strategies to control the expression of such surfaces and to avoid their disappearance over time. Here, we use density functional theory to explore the adsorption of carbon dioxide on the surfaces of Cerium oxide (CeO 2), and its relationship with the resulting nanoparticle morphology under conditions of pressure and temperature. CeO 2 is an important solid electrolyte in fuel cells, a catalyst, and enzyme mimetic agent in biomedicine, and has been shown to interact strongly with CO 2. We demonstrate that the adsorption of CO 2 as a carbonate ion is energetically favorable on the {\{}111{\}}, {\{}110{\}} and {\{}100{\}} surfaces of CeO 2 , and that the strength of this interaction is morphology and surface stoichiometry dependent. By predicting the surface stability as a function of temperature and pressure, we built surface phase diagrams and predict the surface dependent desorption temperatures of CO 2. These temperatures of desorption follow the order {\{}100{\}} {\textgreater} {\{}110{\}} {\textgreater} {\{}111{\}} and are higher for surfaces containing oxygen vacancies compared to stoichiometric surfaces, indicating that surface oxidation processes can reduce the stability of surface carbonate groups. Finally, we propose a thermodynamic strategy to predict the evolution of nanoparticle morphology in the presence of CO 2 as the external conditions of temperature and pressure change. We show that there is a thermodynamic driving force dependent on CO 2 adsorption that should be considered when selecting nanoparticle morphologies in catalytic applications.

abstract = {Radiolytic corrosion of actinide materials represent an issue for the long term storage and disposal of nuclear materials. Molecular species adsorbed at the surface of the actinides may impact the rate of radiolysis, and as the surfaces corrode, the soluble toxic and radioactive species leach into groundwater. It is therefore critical to characterise the surface composition of actinides. Here, we employ ab initio modelling to determine the surface composition of PuO2 with respect to adsorbed CO2. We found that CO2 interacts strongly with the surface forming carbonate species. By mapping the energetics of this interaction, we then calculate the temperature of desorption, finding that surface morphology has a strong impact on the adsorption of CO2, with the {\{}100{\}} being the most and the {\{}111{\}} the least affected by carbonation. Finally, we predict the effect of carbonation on the morphology of PuO2 nanoparticles as a function of temperature and pressure, finding that truncated octahedral is the preferred morphology. This modelling strategy helps characterise surface compensition and nanoparticle morphology, and we discuss the implication for radiolytically driven dispersal of material into the environment.},

abstract = {The surface structure and composition of functional materials are well known to be critically important factors controlling the surface reactivity. However, when doped the surface composition will change and the challenge is to identify its impact on important surface processes and nanoparticle morphologies. We have begun to address this by using a combination of density functional theory and potential-based methods to investigate the effect of surface dopants on water adsorption and morphology of the technologically important material, CeO2, which finds application as electrolyte in SOFCs, catalyst in soot combustion, and enzyme mimetic agent in biomedicine. We show that by mapping CeO2 surface phase diagrams we can predict nanoparticle morphologies as a function of dopant, temperature and water partial pressure. Our results show that a low temperature, un-doped CeO2 nanocubes with active {\{}100{\}} surface sites are thermodynamically stable. But at the typical high temperature operating},
